# Machine Learning

Implementations of machine learning algorithms:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
- Decision Tree and Random Forest
- Predictions based on (person) similarity
- Collaborative Filtering.

In the case of folders than include **ph** in their names, one needs to add a **.env** file in the same directory as the requirements.txt file. It is necessary for the API requests to work.


The **.env** file should contain the following line:  
TMDB_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
